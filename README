# Pygame Project

This project is a simple game developed using the Pygame library in Python. It serves as an introductory example to help me get started with game development in Python. The game demonstrates basic concepts such as creating a game window, handling user input, and rendering graphics.

## Features

- **Game Window**: A window where the game is displayed.
- **User Input**: Handling keyboard and mouse inputs to interact with the game.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Drawing shapes, images, and text on the screen.
- **Basic Game Loop**: An example of a game loop to update and render the game continuously.

## Learning Objectives

By working through this project, I will learn:
- How to set up a Pygame project.
- How to create and manage a game window.
- How to handle user input to control game elements.
- How to render graphics and text on the screen.
- How to implement a basic game loop.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
